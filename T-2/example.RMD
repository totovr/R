## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Our own chunk

We will calculate $\sqrt{2} - e^{-2}$:

```{R myFirstChunk, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
sqrt(2) - exp(-2)
```

<!-- This will throw a message in this case about the library required -->
<!-- comment=NA will not show the ## -->

```{r magic, message=TRUE, comment=NA}
library(magic)
magic(6)
```

```{r , echo = TRUE, message=TRUE}
library(car)
head(cars,3)
```
