#### From now determinate the year, the day and the time (hour and minutes) after 250 million of seconds passed

```
seconds <- 250e+6

predictTime = function(t){
  minutes = 250000000/60
  hours  = minutes%/%60
  minutes = round(minutes%%60)
  days = hours%/%24
  hours = hours%%24
  years = days%/%365
  days = (days%%365)-2
  actualYear = 2018 + years
  sprintf("%i:%i of the day %i of the year %i", hours, minutes, days, actualYear)
}

predictTime(seconds)
```

#### Create a function that that solve an equation of first grade

```
firstEq = function(a, b){
  # Ax+B=0
  -b/a
}

firstEq(2,4)
```
#### Give an expression to calculate 3e-Ï€ rounded to 3 decimal places
```
round(3*exp(1)-pi,3)     
```
#### Give the complex number module (2 + 3i) ^ 2 / (5 + 8i) rounded to 3 decimal places
```
rounderImaginary = Mod((2+3i) ^ 2 / (5 + 8i))
round(rounderImaginary,3)
```
