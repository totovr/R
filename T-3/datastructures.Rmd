# Vectors

## Data types in R

A **vector** is an ordered sequence of data. `R` has many types of data, for example:

- `logical`: logical (``` TRUE``` or ```FALSE```)
- `integer`: whole numbers, $\mathbb Z$
- `numeric`: real numbers, $\mathbb R$
- `complex`: complex numbers, $\mathbb C$
- `character`: words

In the vectors of `R`, all their objects must be of the same type: all numbers, all words, etc. When we want to use vectors formed by objects of different types, we will have to use **generalized lists**, 'lists' that we will see at the end of the topic.

## Basic

- ```c()```: to define a vector
- ```scan()```: to define a vector
- ```fix(x)```: to visually modify the vector $x$
- ```rep(a, n)```: to define a constant vector that contains the data $a$ repeated $n$ times

```{r example_rep}
c(1,2,3)
rep("Tono",5)
```


## scan() function 

This functions also work with URL with text files

**Example**

This is an example of how to create a vector that contains 3 copies of 1 9 9 8 0 7 2 6 with the scan function:
<div class = "aligncenter">
![](../Imgs/scan.png)
</div>

## Progressions and Sequences

An arithmetic progression is a succession of numbers such that the **difference**, $d$, of any pair of successive terms in the sequence is constant.
$$a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \ cdot d$$

- ```seq (a, b, by=d)```: to generate an [arithmetic progression](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArhythmicProgression) of difference $d$ that starts in $to$ up get to $b$
- ```seq (a, b, length.out=n)```: define arithmetic progression of length $n$ ranging from $a$ to $b$ with difference $d$. Therefore $d = (b-a) / (n-1)$
- ```seq (a, by= d, length.out=n)```: define the arithmetic progression of length $n$ and difference $d$ starting in $a$
- ```a:b```: define the sequence of consecutive numbers ** ($\mathbb{Z}$) between two numbers $a$ and $b$

## Example of sequence 

* This is an example of a sequence `r seq(5, 60, by = 3.5)`
* If we want a sequence of **n** lengh we can use `r seq(5, 60, length.out = 7)`
* If we want to start in n number and have a determinate lenght with n step we use `r seq(5, length.out = 7, by = 3)`

## Sequences Exercises

- Numbers sequence from 1 ot 20:  `r 1:20`
- First 20 pair numbers: `r seq(2,by=2, length.out=20)`
- 30 equidistant numbers bettwen 17 and 98 with 4 significative decimals: 
```{r sequence_round, echo=FALSE, results='asis'} 
seqX = seq(17,98, length.out=30)
signif(seqX , digits = 6)
```

## Example of vector 

This is another example to generate a vector, c is also named as concatenation:

```{r concatenation, echo=TRUE}
c(rep(pi, 5), 5:10, -7) -> x
x
c(0, x, 10, x, 20)
```

## Functions

When we want to apply a function to each of the elements of a data vector, the `sapply` function saves us having to program with loops in `R`:

- ```sapply(vector_name, FUN = function_name)```: to apply this function to all vector elements
- ```sqrt(x)```: Calculate a new vector with the square roots of each of the elements of the vector $x$

## Example of use sapply function 

```{r sapply_function_other_topology, echo=TRUE}
x <- 1:10
sapply(x, FUN = function(w){sqrt(w)})
```

```{r sapply_other_topology, echo=TRUE}
sapply(x, function(w)sqrt(w))
```

## Functions

Given a vector of data $x$ we can calculate many statistical measures about it:

- ```length(x)```: Calculate the length of the vector $x$
- ```max(x)```: calculates the maximum of the vector $x$
- ```min(x)```: Calculate the minimum of the vector $x$
- ```sum(x)```: calculates the sum of the entries of the vector $x$
- ```prod(x)```: Calculate the product of the vector entries $x$

## Functions

- ```mean(x)```: calculates the arithmetic mean of the entries in the vector $x$
- ```diff(x)```: calculates the vector formed by the successive differences between entries of the original vector $x$
- ```cumsum(x)```: calculates the vector formed by the cumulative sums of the original vector entries $x$
  - Allows to define sequences described by summation
  - Each entry of ``cumsum(x)`` is the sum of the $x$ entries up to its position
  
## Functions

```{r functions_example}
square_fun = function(x){x^2}
v = c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
sapply(v, FUN = square_fun)
mean(v)
cumsum(v)
```

## Order

- ```sort(x)```: order the vector in natural order of the objects that form it: the increasing numerical order, alphabetical order ...
- ```rev(x)```: invert the order of the vector elements $x$

```{r order_example}
v = c(1,7,5,2,4,6,3)
sort(v)
rev(v)
```

## Order Exercises

```{r order_exercise_one, results='asis'}
v = c(1,7,5,2,4,6,3)
s = sort(v)
rev(s)
```

```{r order_exercise_one_shorter, results='asis'}
v = c(1,7,5,2,4,6,3)
sort(v, decreasing = TRUE)
```

```{r order_exercise_two, results='asis'}
v = c(1,7,5,2,4,6,3)
s = rev(v)
sort(s)
```

## Subvectors

- ```vector[i]```: gives the $i$ -th entry of the vector

  - R indexes start at 1
  - ```vector[length(vector)]```: gives us the last entry of the vector
  - ```vector[a:b]```: if $a$ and $b$ are two natural numbers, the subvector gives us with the entries of the original vector that go from the $to$-th position until the $b$-th.
  - ```vector [-i]```: if $i$ is a number, this subvector is made up of all the entries of the original vector except the $i$ -th entry. If $i$ turns out to be a vector, then it is an index vector and creates a new vector with the entries of the original vector, whose indexes belong to $i$
  - ```vector[-x]```: if $x$ is a vector (of indices), then this is the complement of vector [$x$]
  
## Subvectors

- Also has logic operators:
	
	- ```==```: =
	- ```!=```: $\neq$
	- ```>=```: $\ge$  
	- ```<=```: $\le$
	- ```<```: $<$
	- ```>```: $>$
	- ```!```: NO logic
	- ```&```: AND logic
	- ```|```: OR logic
	
## Subvectors

```{r}
v = c(14,5,6,19,32,0,8)
v[2]
v[-c(3,5)]
v[v != 19 & v>15]
```

## Subvectors

```{r}
w = seq(3, 50, by = 3.5) 
w
w[4:8]
w[8:4]
w[seq(2, length(w), by = 2)]
```

## Subvectors

```{r}
w[seq(1, length(w), by = 2)]
w[-seq(2, length(w), by = 2)]
w[(length(w)-2):length(w)]
w[c(1,5,6)]
```

## Subvectors

```{r}
w[w>30]
w[w>20 & w<40]
w[w!=3 & w!=17]
w[w<10|w>40]
```

## Subvectors

```{r}
w[w>=10]
w[w>10]
w[!w<10]
w[w%%2==0]
w[w%%2==1]
w>30
```

## Subvectors

```{r}
w[w%%2==1]
w>30
```

## Subvectors

If we evaluate one vector in another vector, this will evaluate the **position** that meet the condition, also just can be possible if the two vectors has the same length 

```{r, results='hold'}
x = c(1,7,4,2,4,8,9,2,0)
y = c(5,2,-3,-7,-1,4,-2,7,1)
x
y>0
x[y>0]
```

## Conditional

- ```which(x meets condition)```: to obtain the indexes of the $x$ vector entries that satisfy the given condition
- ```which.min(x)```: gives us the first position in which the vector $x$ takes its minimum value
- ```which(x==min(x))```: gives all the positions in which the vector $x$ takes its minimum values
- ```which.max(x)```: gives us the first position in which the vector $x$ takes its maximum value
- ```which(x ==max(x))```: gives all the positions in which the vector $x$ takes its maximum values

## Conditional

if we use which inside the vector this will return the values, not the positions

```{r}
x
which(x>4)
x[which(x>4)]
x[x>4]
```
## Conditional

The first one shows the positions and the second one shows the values that are in those positions
```{r, results='hold'}
x
which(x<5 | x%%2==0)
x[which(x<5 | x%%2==0)]
```

## Conditional

Display the location of the minimum value that is 0, $which.min(x)$ show just the first value that is found, in this case there is just one 0 so $which(x==min(x))$ will also show the 0
```{r, results='hold'}
x
which.min(x)
which(x==min(x))
```

## Conditional

Display the location of the minimum value that is 0, $which.min(x)$ show just the first value that is found, in this case there is just one 0 so $which(x==min(x))$ will also show the 0
```{r, results='hold'}
x = c(1, 7, 4, 2, 4, 8, 9, 2, 0, 9)
which.max(x)
which(x==max(x))
```

## NA Values

Sometimes vectors has NA values so that we need to attack this cases in the next form:

Dont taking in to account the NA values with $na.rm=true$, this is not recommended.
```{r, results='hold'}
x = c(1, 7, 4, 2, 4, 8, 9, 2, 0, NA, NA, NA, 9)
sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(x, na.rm =TRUE)
```
## NA Values

We will use instead the function $is.na(somevector)$, this will show us the possition of the **NA values** with a TRUE statement

```{r, results='hold'}
x
is.na(x)
```

Now we can determinate the position with:
```{r, results='hold'}
which(is.na(x))
```
## NA Values

If we want to know the values (already assuming that will show NA) , this are already the values not the positions
```{r} 
x[which(is.na(x))]
```
Now lets write the mean of this vector to fill the NA, this is more recommended than delate the NA

```{r} 
y = x
y[which(is.na(y))] = mean(y, na.rm=TRUE)
y
```
## NA Values

Another way to doesnt take in to account the NA values is with the function:

```{r} 
x
x_clean = na.omit(x)
x_clean
```

## NA Values

This will generate attributes, that can be delated with:

```{r} 
x_clean
attr(x_clean, "na.action") = NULL
attr(x_clean, "class") = NULL
x_clean
```
## Factors

<l class = "definition"> Factor</l>: it's like a vector, but with a richer internal structure that allows it to be used to classify observations

- `levels`: factor attribute. Each element of the factor is equal to one level. The levels classify the inputs of the factor. They are sorted alphabetically
- To define a factor, we must first define a vector and transform it by means of one of the functions `factor()` or `as.factor()`.

```{r} 
gender = c("M", "F", "M", "F", "F", "F", "F", "M", "M")
gender.fact = factor(gender)
gender.fact
```
## Factors

Another way to express a factor 
 
```{r} 
gender.fact2 = as.factor(gender)
gender.fact2
```
## Modify a factors

Is possible to add more levels

```{r} 
gender.fact3 = factor(gender, levels = c("M", "F", "B"))
gender.fact3
```
## Modify a factors

Is possible to add labels

```{r} 
gender.fact4 = factor(gender, levels = c("M", "F", "B"), labels = c("Male", "Female", "Bisexual"))
gender.fact4
```

## Check levels of a factor

To check the levels that hold a factor 

```{r} 
levels(gender.fact)
levels(gender.fact4)
```
## Modify level of a factor

To check the levels that hold a factor 

```{r} 
levels(gender.fact4) = c("Male", "Female", "Bi")
gender.fact4
```

## Example

```{r} 
note = c(1,2,3,4,4,3,4,3,2,1,2,3,4)
note.fact = factor(note)
note.fact
```

## Example

```{r} 
levels(note.fact)
levels(note.fact) = c("fail", "good", "very good", "excellent")
note.fact
```

## Example

Is possible to group different levels 

```{r} 
note
levels(note.fact) = c("fail", "good", "good", "good")
note.fact
```

## Ordered factor

<l class = "definition"> Ordered factor.</l> It is a factor where the levels follow an order

- `ordered (vector, levels = ...)`: function that defines an ordered factor and has the same parameters as factor

## Ordered factor

```{r} 
note
ordered(note, labels = c("fail", "good", "very good", "excellent"))
```

## Ordered factor example

```{r}
fac = factor(c(1,1,1,2,2,3,2,4,1,3,3,4,2,3,4,4), 
       levels = c(1,2,3,4), labels = c("Sus","Apr","Not","Exc"))
fac
facOrd = ordered(c(1,1,1,2,2,3,2,4,1,3,3,4,2,3,4,4), 
       levels = c(1,2,3,4), labels = c("Sus","Apr","Not","Exc"))
facOrd
```

## Lists
<l class = "definition"> List. </l> List consisting of different objects, not necessarily of the same type, each with an internal name

- `list (...)`: function that creates a list
  - To obtain a specific component we use the `list $ component` instruction
  - We can also indicate the object by its position using double square brackets: `list [[i]]`. What we will get is a list formed by that single component, not the object that forms the component
  
## Get information of one list

If we want to access to one component of the list is necessary to use the character $\$$

```{r}
x = c(1,-2,3,4,-5,6,7,-8,-9,0)
L = list(name = "Temperature", vector = x, mean_list = mean(x), summation = cumsum(x))
L
L$mean_list
```
## Get information of one list

Also with the position, it needs to have double bracket, we will get the vector in this case
```{r}
L[[2]]
```

## Get information of one list

- `str(list)`: to know the intern structure of one list
- `names(list)`: to know the names of the list

```{r}
str(L) # get the structure of the list 
names(L)
```
# Matrix

## How to define them

- `matrix (vector, nrow = n, byrow = logical_value)`: to define a matrix of $ n $ rows formed by the entries of the vector
  - `nrow`: number of rows
  - `byrow`: if it is equal to TRUE, the matrix is constructed by rows; if it is equal to FALSE (default value), it is constructed by columns.
  -` ncol`: number of columns (can be used instead of nrow)
  - R shows the matrices indicating as [$ i, $] the $ i $ -th row and [$, j $] the $ j $ -th column
- All entries in an array must be of the same type of data

## Matrix example

```{r}
M = matrix(1:12, nrow= 4)
M
M = matrix(1:12, nrow= 4, byrow = TRUE)
M
```
## Matrix example

```{r}
M = matrix(1:12, nrow= 3)
M
```

## Matrix example

If we write a number of rows that is not mulptiple of the data lenght it will filled with the begging numbers 

```{r}
M = matrix(1:12, nrow= 5)
M
```
## Matrix example

If we just have one data

```{r}
M = matrix(1, nrow= 4, ncol = 6)
M
```
## Matrix exercise

- How would you define a constant matrix? That is, how would you define a $A$ matrix such that $\forall\  i=1,...,n; j = 1,...,m$, $a_{i,j}=k$  where $k\in\mathbb{R}$? Since R does not admit unknowns, test for the specific case $n = 3, m = 5, k = 0$

```{r}
matrix(0, nrow = 3, ncol = 5)
```
## Matrix exercise

- With the vector vec = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12) create a matrix

```{r}
vec <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12)
m_example <- matrix(vec, nrow = 3)
m_example
```
## How to build a matrix with other functions

- `rbind (vector1, vector2, ...)`: construct the array of rows vector1, vector2, ...
- `cbind (vector1, vector2, ...)`: construct the column matrix vector1, vector2, ...
  - Vectors must have the same length
  - It also serves to add columns (rows) to an array or concatenate columns (rows) matrices with the same number of rows (columns)
- `diag (vector)`: to construct a diagonal matrix with a given vector
  - If we apply diag to a $n$ number, it produces an identity matrix of order $n$
  
## How to build a matrix with other functions

Here we added the rows or we can also generate another matrix

```{r}
M = matrix(1:12, nrow= 3)
rbind(M, c(1,2,3,4), c(5,6,7,8))
rbind(c(1,2,3,4), c(5,6,7,8))
```
## How to build a matrix with other functions

Here we added the vectors in columns

```{r}
cbind(c(1,2,3,4), c(5,6,7,8))
```

## How to build a matrix with other functions

Now we will generate a identity matrix with the *diag* function

```{r}
diag(5, nrow=3)
```

## Submatrix

- `matrix [i,j]`: indicates the entry ($i,j$) of the matrix, being $i,j\in\mathbb{N}$. If $i$ and $j$ are index vectors, we will be defining the submatrix with the rows belonging to the vector $i$ and columns belonging to the vector $j$
- `matrix [i,]`: indicates the $ i $ -th row of the matrix, being $i\in\mathbb{N}$
- `matrix [, j]`: indicates the $ j $ -th column of the being $j\in\mathbb{N}$
  - If $i$ ($j$) is an index vector, we will be defining the submatrix with the rows (columns) belonging to the vector $i$ ($j$)

## Submatrix

```{r}
M
M[2,3]
M[2,]
M[,2]
```

## Submatrix

```{r}
M
M[c(2,3), 1:2]
```

## Functions

- `diag(matrix)`: to obtain the diagonal of the matrix
- `nrow(matrix)`: returns the number of rows in the matrix
- `ncol(matrix)`: returns the number of columns in the matrix
- `dim(matrix)`: returns the dimensions of the matrix
- `sum(matrix)`: we get the sum of all the entries in the matrix
- `prod(matrix)`: we get the product of all the entries in the matrix
- `mean(matrix)`: we get the arithmetic mean of all the entries in the matrix

## Functions example

```{r}
M
diag(M)
nrow(M)
ncol(M)
```
## Functions

- `colSums(matrix)`: we obtain the sums by columns of the matrix
- `rowSums(matrix)`: we obtain the sums by rows of the matrix
- `colMeans(matrix)`: we obtain the arithmetic means by columns of the matrix
- `rowMeans(matrix)`: we obtain the arithmetic means by rows of the matrix

## Functions example

```{r}
M
colSums(M)
rowSums(M)
colMeans(M)
```
## Functions example

Given the matrix $$A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 4 & 7\\
2 & 5 & 8\\
3 & 6 & 9
\end{pmatrix}$$
</div>

```{r}
A = matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), ncol = 3)
dim(A)
diag(A)
```

## Función apply()

- `apply (matrix, MARGIN = ..., FUN = function)`: to apply other functions to the rows or columns of an array
  - `MARGIN`: must be 1 if we want to apply the function by rows; 2 if we want to apply it by columns; or c (1,2) if we want to apply it to each entry

```{r, echo=FALSE}
A
sqrt_sum_function = function(argA){
  sqrt(sum(argA^2))
}
```
```{r}
apply(A, MARGIN = 1, FUN = sqrt_sum_function)
apply(A, MARGIN = c(1,2), FUN = function(argA){argA^2})
```
## Note

**sapply** casts the data frame, to a list or vector before operating on it, **apply** casts the data frame to a matrix. Since matrices cannot have mixed types and there is at least one column with non-numeric data, then everything becomes character data.

## Función apply()

```{r}
cuadrado = function(x){x^2}
A
apply(A, MARGIN = c(1,2), FUN = cuadrado)
apply(A, MARGIN = 1, FUN = sum)
apply(A, MARGIN = 2, FUN = sum)
```
## Función apply()

```{r}
A
apply(A, MARGIN = 1, FUN = sum)
apply(A, MARGIN = 2, FUN = sum)
```

## Operations

- `t(matrix)`: to obtain the matrix transpose
- `+`: to add matrices
- `*`: for the product of a scalar by a matrix
- `% *%`: to multiply matrices
- `mtx.exp(matrix,n)`: to raise the matrix to $n$
  - From the `Biodem` package
- Does not calculate the exact powers, approximates them
- `%%`: to raise matrices
  - From the `expm` package
- Does not calculate the exact powers, approximates them

## Transpose of a matrix

```{r}
M
t(M)
```

## Multiply two matrix

We will multiply $W * W$, note this is not the same as $W^2$
```{r, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
W = M[1:3, 1:3] # This is to obtain a 3*3 matrix
```

```{r}
W
W%*%W
```

## Operations exercise 

If $A = \begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 & 2\\
1 & 2 & 3\\
0 & 1 & 3
\end{pmatrix}$ and $B = \begin{pmatrix}
3 & 2 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 0\\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}$, do the next operations $A*B$, $A^2$ and $B^3$

## Operations exercise 

A*B

```{r}
eA = rbind(c(2,0,2), c(1,2,3), c(0,1,3))
eB = rbind(c(3,2,1), c(1,0,0), c(1,1,1))
eA%*%eB
```
## Operations exercise 

$A^2$ and $B^3$

```{r}
eA^2
eB^3
```
